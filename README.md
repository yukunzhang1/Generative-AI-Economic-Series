**Reconstructing Economic Growth, Market Structure, and Information Contracts in the Age of Generative AI**

As generative AI reshapes the world at an exponential pace, traditional economic theories struggle to explain a new economic species characterized by *near-zero marginal cost* and *autonomous creativity*. This research series brings together **seven tightly connected papers** that collectively aim to rebuild the foundations of economics for the AI era.

Rather than treating AI as a mere productivity tool, this series reconceptualizes it as **a new form of capital** and **a pervasive economic ecosystem**. Spanning **macro dynamics**, **meso-level market structures**, and **micro-level strategic interactions**, the series addresses three fundamental questions:

- *What is AI in an economic sense?*
- *How does AI restructure markets and labor?*
- *How can trust, incentives, and contracts survive in an AI-driven information environment?*

> Abstract: This paper develops a micro-founded economic theory of the AI industry by modeling large language models as a distinct asset class-Digital Intelligence Capital-characterized by data-compute complementarities, increasing returns to scale, and relative (rather than absolute) valuation. We show that these features fundamentally reshape industry dynamics along three dimensions. First, because downstream demand depends on relative capability, innovation by one firm endogenously depreciates the economic value of rivals' existing capital, generating a persistent innovation pressure we term the Red Queen Effect. Second, falling inference prices induce downstream firms to adopt more compute-intensive agent architectures, rendering aggregate demand for compute super-elastic and producing a structural Jevons paradox. Third, learning from user feedback creates a data flywheel that can destabilize symmetric competition: when data accumulation outpaces data decay, the market bifurcates endogenously toward a winner-takes-all equilibrium. We further characterize conditions under which expanding upstream capabilities erode downstream application value (the Wrapper Trap). A calibrated agent-based model confirms these mechanisms and their quantitative implications. Together, the results provide a unified framework linking intelligence production upstream with agentic demand downstream, offering new insights into competition, scalability, and regulation in the AI economy.

> Abstract:This paper conceptualizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as a form of mixed public goods within digital infrastructure, analyzing their economic properties through a comprehensive theoretical framework. We develop mathematical models to quantify the non-rivalry characteristics, partial excludability, and positive externalities of LLMs. Through comparative analysis of open-source and closed-source development paths, we identify systematic differences in resource allocation efficiency, innovation trajectories, and access equity. Our empirical research evaluates the spillover effects and network externalities of LLMs across different domains, including knowledge diffusion, innovation acceleration, and industry transformation. Based on these findings, we propose policy recommendations for balancing innovation incentives with equitable access, including public-private partnership mechanisms, computational resource democratization, and governance structures that optimize social welfare. This interdisciplinary approach contributes to understanding the economic nature of foundation AI models and provides policy guidance for their development as critical digital infrastructure

> **Abstract:**The diffusion of Generative AI (GenAI) constitutes a supply shock of a fundamentally different nature: while marginal production costs approach zero, content generation creates congestion externalities through information pollution. We develop a three-layer general equilibrium framework to study how this non-convex technology reshapes market structure, transition dynamics, and social welfare. In a static vertical differentiation model, we show that the GenAI cost shock induces a kinked production frontier that bifurcates the market into exit, AI, and human segments, generating a ``middle-class hollow'' in the quality distribution. To analyze adjustment paths, we embed this structure in a mean-field evolutionary system and a calibrated agent-based model with bounded rationality. The transition to the AI-integrated equilibrium is non-monotonic: rather than smooth diffusion, the economy experiences a temporary ecological collapse driven by search frictions and delayed skill adaptation, followed by selective recovery. Survival depends on asymmetric skill reconfiguration, whereby humans retreat from technical execution toward semantic creativity. Finally, we show that the welfare impact of AI adoption is highly sensitive to pollution intensity: low congestion yields monotonic welfare gains, whereas high pollution produces an inverted-U relationship in which further AI expansion reduces total welfare. These results imply that laissez-faire adoption can be inefficient and that optimal governance must shift from input regulation toward output-side congestion management.

> Abstract:This paper presents a unified computational framework to examine how generative AI (GenAI) reshapes welfare, inequality, and diversity in content platform economies. By integrating welfare economics with agent-based simulations, we model the co-evolutionary dynamics among AI generators, human creators, and consumers within a two-sided market characterized by multi-dimensional quality heterogeneity. Unlike static models, our framework endogenizes AI learning as a function of human data synthesis and models human adaptation as a strategic reallocation of skills toward creative niches. The results reveal that while GenAI significantly enhances consumer surplus through technical quality gains and price depression, it triggers a skill-biased displacement of human incumbents and intensifies market concentration. Through the evaluation of six governance regimes, we identify a fundamental ``Policy Trilemma'' where platforms must navigate non-trivial trade-offs between allocative efficiency, distributional equity, and ecosystem sustainability. Our findings highlight that algorithmic diversity and pro-creative commission structures function as essential economic mechanisms for sustaining long-tail participation and inclusive social welfare in the generative AI era.

> **Abstract:** The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shock to the economics of information production. By asymmetrically collapsing the marginal cost of generating low-quality, synthetic content while leaving high-quality production costly, AI systematically incentivizes information pollution. This paper develops a general equilibrium framework to analyze this challenge. We model the strategic interactions among a monopolistic platform, profit-maximizing producers, and utility-maximizing consumers in a three-stage game. The core of our model is a production technology with differential elasticities of substitution (\sigma_L > 1 > \sigma_H), which formalizes the insight that AI is a substitute for labor in low-quality production but a complement in high-quality creation. We prove the existence of a unique "Polluted Information Equilibrium" and demonstrate its inefficiency, which is driven by a threefold market failure: a production externality, a platform governance failure, and an information commons externality. Methodologically, we derive a theoretically-grounded Information Pollution Index (IPI) with endogenous welfare weights to measure ecosystem health. From a policy perspective, we show that a first-best outcome requires a portfolio of instruments targeting each failure. Finally, considering the challenges of deep uncertainty, we advocate for an adaptive governance framework where policy instruments are dynamically adjusted based on real-time IPI readings, offering a robust blueprint for regulating information markets in the age of AI.

> **Abstract:** The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the information environment, creating both opportunities and challenges. This paper explores how generative AI influences economic rent-seeking behavior and its broader impact on social welfare. We develop a dynamic economic model involving multiple agents who may engage in rent-seeking activities and a regulator aiming to mitigate social welfare losses. Our analysis reveals a dual effect of generative AI: while it reduces traditional information rents by increasing transparency, it also introduces new forms of rent-seeking, such as information manipulation and algorithmic interference. These behaviors can lead to decreased social welfare by exacerbating information asymmetries and misallocating resources. To address these challenges, we propose policy interventions, including taxation and regulatory measures. This study provides a new perspective on the economic implications of generative AI, offering valuable insights for policymakers and laying a foundation for future research on regulating AI-driven economic behaviors.

> **Abstract:** Information asymmetry often leads to adverse selection and moral hazard in economic markets, causing inefficiencies and welfare losses. Traditional methods to address these issues, such as signaling and screening, are frequently insufficient. This research investigates how Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can create detailed informational signals that help principals better understand agents' types and monitor their actions. By incorporating these AI-generated signals into a principal-agent model, the study aims to reduce inefficiencies and improve contract designs. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we demonstrate that Generative AI can effectively mitigate adverse selection and moral hazard, resulting in more efficient market outcomes and increased social welfare. Additionally, the findings offer practical insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders on the responsible implementation of Generative AI solutions to enhance market performance.
