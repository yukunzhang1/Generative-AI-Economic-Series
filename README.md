**Reconstructing Economic Growth, Market Structure, and Information Contracts in the Age of Generative AI**

*A unified economic framework for understanding Generative AI as capital, infrastructure, and strategic actor.*

As generative AI reshapes the world at an exponential pace, traditional economic theories struggle to explain a new economic species characterized by *near-zero marginal cost* and *autonomous creativity*. This research series brings together **seven tightly connected papers** that collectively aim to rebuild the foundations of economics for the AI era.

Rather than treating AI as a mere productivity tool, this series reconceptualizes it as **a new form of capital** and **a pervasive economic ecosystem**. Spanning **macro dynamics**, **meso-level market structures**, and **micro-level strategic interactions**, the series addresses three fundamental questions:

- *What is AI in an economic sense?*
- *How does AI restructure markets, platforms, and labor?*
- *How can trust, incentives, and contracts survive in an AI-driven information environment?*

> **Abstract:**  
> This paper develops a micro-founded economic theory of the AI industry by modeling large language models as a distinct asset class—**Digital Intelligence Capital**—characterized by data–compute complementarities, increasing returns to scale, and relative (rather than absolute) valuation. We show that these features fundamentally reshape industry dynamics along three dimensions. First, because downstream demand depends on relative capability, innovation by one firm endogenously depreciates the economic value of rivals’ existing capital, generating a persistent innovation pressure we term the **Red Queen Effect**. Second, falling inference prices induce downstream firms to adopt more compute-intensive agent architectures, rendering aggregate demand for compute super-elastic and producing a **structural Jevons paradox**. Third, learning from user feedback creates a data flywheel that can destabilize symmetric competition: when data accumulation outpaces data decay, the market bifurcates endogenously toward a **winner-takes-all equilibrium**. We further characterize conditions under which expanding upstream capabilities erode downstream application value (the **Wrapper Trap**). A calibrated agent-based model confirms these mechanisms and their quantitative implications. Together, the results provide a unified framework linking upstream intelligence production with downstream agentic demand, offering new insights into competition, scalability, and regulation in the AI economy.

> **Abstract:**  
> This paper conceptualizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as a form of **quasi-public goods** embedded within digital infrastructure, and analyzes their economic properties through a unified theoretical framework. We formally characterize the non-rivalry, partial excludability, and positive externalities of LLMs, and study how these features differentiate them from conventional private or public capital. Through a comparative analysis of **open-source** and **closed-source** development regimes, we identify systematic differences in innovation incentives, access equity, and resource allocation efficiency. Our empirical analysis further evaluates spillover effects and network externalities across domains such as knowledge diffusion, innovation acceleration, and industrial transformation. Based on these results, we propose policy mechanisms to balance innovation incentives with equitable access, including public–private partnerships, compute-access governance, and infrastructure-oriented regulatory design. Together, the paper reframes foundation models as critical digital infrastructure and provides policy guidance for maximizing their social welfare impact.

)

> **Abstract:**  
> The diffusion of Generative AI (GenAI) constitutes a supply shock of a fundamentally different nature. While marginal production costs approach zero, large-scale content generation creates congestion externalities through information pollution. We develop a three-layer general equilibrium framework to analyze how this **non-convex technology** reshapes market structure, transition dynamics, and social welfare. In a static vertical differentiation model, we show that the GenAI cost shock induces a kinked production frontier that bifurcates the market into exit, AI, and human segments, generating a **“middle-class hollow”** in the quality distribution. To capture dynamic adjustment, we embed this structure in a mean-field evolutionary system and a calibrated agent-based model with bounded rationality. The transition to the AI-integrated equilibrium is non-monotonic: rather than smooth diffusion, the economy experiences a temporary ecological collapse driven by search frictions and delayed skill adaptation, followed by selective recovery. Survival hinges on asymmetric skill reconfiguration, with humans retreating from technical execution toward semantic creativity. Finally, we show that welfare effects are highly sensitive to congestion intensity: low pollution yields monotonic welfare gains, whereas high pollution produces an inverted-U relationship in which further AI expansion reduces total welfare. These results imply that laissez-faire adoption can be inefficient and that optimal governance should shift from input regulation toward **output-side congestion management**.

> **Abstract:**  
> This paper presents a unified computational framework to examine how Generative AI (GenAI) reshapes welfare, inequality, and diversity in content platform economies. By integrating welfare economics with agent-based simulations, we model the co-evolutionary dynamics among AI generators, human creators, and consumers within a two-sided market characterized by multi-dimensional quality heterogeneity. Unlike static models, our framework endogenizes AI learning as a function of human data synthesis and models human adaptation as a strategic reallocation of skills toward creative niches. The results reveal that while GenAI significantly enhances consumer surplus through technical quality gains and price depression, it triggers a skill-biased displacement of human incumbents and intensifies market concentration. Through the evaluation of six governance regimes, we identify a fundamental **Policy Trilemma**, where platforms must navigate non-trivial trade-offs between allocative efficiency, distributional equity, and ecosystem sustainability. Our findings highlight that algorithmic diversity and pro-creative commission structures function as essential economic mechanisms for sustaining long-tail participation and inclusive social welfare in the generative AI era.

> **Abstract:**  
> The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) constitutes a fundamental shock to the economics of information production by asymmetrically collapsing the marginal cost of low-quality synthetic content while leaving high-quality production costly, thereby systematically incentivizing information pollution. This paper develops a general equilibrium framework to analyze how such pollution emerges and persists through the strategic interaction of a monopolistic platform, profit-maximizing producers, and utility-maximizing consumers in a three-stage game. We formalize AI as a production technology with differential elasticities of substitution $(\sigma_L > 1 > \sigma_H)$, capturing its role as a substitute for labor in low-quality production and a complement in high-quality creation, and prove the existence of a unique **Polluted Information Equilibrium** characterized by inefficiency. This inefficiency arises from a threefold market failure: a production externality, a platform governance failure, and an information commons externality. Methodologically, we introduce a theoretically grounded **Information Pollution Index (IPI)** with endogenous welfare weights to measure ecosystem health, and show that achieving a first-best outcome requires a coordinated portfolio of policy instruments. Recognizing deep uncertainty, we further advocate an **adaptive governance framework** in which regulatory tools are dynamically adjusted in response to real-time IPI signals, offering a robust blueprint for governing information markets in the age of AI.

> **Abstract:**  
> The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has fundamentally reshaped the information environment, creating both efficiency gains and new strategic distortions. This paper investigates how generative AI alters economic rent-seeking behavior and its implications for market transparency and social welfare. We develop a dynamic economic model in which heterogeneous agents can engage in productive activity or AI-enabled rent-seeking, alongside a regulator seeking to mitigate welfare losses. Our analysis reveals a dual effect of generative AI: while it compresses traditional information rents by lowering search and disclosure costs, it simultaneously enables novel forms of rent-seeking, including large-scale information manipulation, strategic signal flooding, and algorithmic interference. These behaviors distort price signals, exacerbate effective information asymmetries, and lead to inefficient resource allocation. We characterize the conditions under which AI-enhanced manipulation dominates transparency gains and show that laissez-faire adoption can reduce aggregate welfare. To address these risks, we evaluate policy instruments such as targeted taxation, disclosure requirements, and algorithmic governance, highlighting their trade-offs and complementarities. The results provide a unified framework for understanding AI-enabled rent-seeking and offer policy guidance for preserving market efficiency in AI-mediated economies.

> **Abstract:**  
> Information asymmetry often leads to adverse selection and moral hazard in economic markets, resulting in inefficiencies and welfare losses. Traditional mechanisms such as signaling and screening are frequently insufficient in complex, high-dimensional environments. This paper investigates how **Generative AI** can produce rich, high-precision informational signals that enable principals to better infer agents’ hidden types and monitor effort. Embedding AI-generated signals into a dynamic principal–agent framework, we show both theoretically and through simulations that Generative AI can significantly mitigate adverse selection and moral hazard, leading to more efficient contracts and higher social welfare. The results further provide policy and governance insights into how AI can be responsibly deployed to reduce information frictions rather than exacerbate them.
