**Reconstructing Economic Growth, Market Structure, and Information Contracts in the Age of Generative AI**

As generative AI reshapes the world at an exponential pace, traditional economic theories struggle to explain a new economic species characterized by *near-zero marginal cost* and *autonomous creativity*. This research series brings together **seven tightly connected papers** that collectively aim to rebuild the foundations of economics for the AI era.

Rather than treating AI as a mere productivity tool, this series reconceptualizes it as **a new form of capital** and **a pervasive economic ecosystem**. Spanning **macro dynamics**, **meso-level market structures**, and **micro-level strategic interactions**, the series addresses three fundamental questions:

- *What is AI in an economic sense?*
- *How does AI restructure markets and labor?*
- *How can trust, incentives, and contracts survive in an AI-driven information environment?*

## 📚 Part I — The Nature of Intelligence & Macroeconomic Dynamics  


**Core Question:**  
Is AI a new form of capital, or a new kind of public infrastructure? This part establishes the **theoretical foundation** of the series by redefining the production function and the drivers of growth.

> Abstract: This paper develops a micro-founded economic theory of the AI industry by modeling large language models as a distinct asset class-Digital Intelligence Capital-characterized by data-compute complementarities, increasing returns to scale, and relative (rather than absolute) valuation. We show that these features fundamentally reshape industry dynamics along three dimensions. First, because downstream demand depends on relative capability, innovation by one firm endogenously depreciates the economic value of rivals' existing capital, generating a persistent innovation pressure we term the Red Queen Effect. Second, falling inference prices induce downstream firms to adopt more compute-intensive agent architectures, rendering aggregate demand for compute super-elastic and producing a structural Jevons paradox. Third, learning from user feedback creates a data flywheel that can destabilize symmetric competition: when data accumulation outpaces data decay, the market bifurcates endogenously toward a winner-takes-all equilibrium. We further characterize conditions under which expanding upstream capabilities erode downstream application value (the Wrapper Trap). A calibrated agent-based model confirms these mechanisms and their quantitative implications. Together, the results provide a unified framework linking intelligence production upstream with agentic demand downstream, offering new insights into competition, scalability, and regulation in the AI economy.

> Abstract:This paper conceptualizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as a form of mixed public goods within digital infrastructure, analyzing their economic properties through a comprehensive theoretical framework. We develop mathematical models to quantify the non-rivalry characteristics, partial excludability, and positive externalities of LLMs. Through comparative analysis of open-source and closed-source development paths, we identify systematic differences in resource allocation efficiency, innovation trajectories, and access equity. Our empirical research evaluates the spillover effects and network externalities of LLMs across different domains, including knowledge diffusion, innovation acceleration, and industry transformation. Based on these findings, we propose policy recommendations for balancing innovation incentives with equitable access, including public-private partnership mechanisms, computational resource democratization, and governance structures that optimize social welfare. This interdisciplinary approach contributes to understanding the economic nature of foundation AI models and provides policy guidance for their development as critical digital infrastructure


## 🏭 Part II — Market Fragmentation and Reconstruction  


**Core Question:**  
When the marginal cost of content creation approaches zero, how do labor markets and platforms fracture? This part focuses on **meso-level market shocks** and structural transitions.


### 3. Supply-Side Shock: The Hollowing Out of the Middle Class

### 🧩 Paper: Generative AI as a Non-Convex Supply Shock: Market Bifurcation and Welfare Analysis

> **Abstract:**The diffusion of Generative AI (GenAI) constitutes a supply shock of a fundamentally different nature: while marginal production costs approach zero, content generation creates congestion externalities through information pollution. We develop a three-layer general equilibrium framework to study how this non-convex technology reshapes market structure, transition dynamics, and social welfare. In a static vertical differentiation model, we show that the GenAI cost shock induces a kinked production frontier that bifurcates the market into exit, AI, and human segments, generating a ``middle-class hollow'' in the quality distribution. To analyze adjustment paths, we embed this structure in a mean-field evolutionary system and a calibrated agent-based model with bounded rationality. The transition to the AI-integrated equilibrium is non-monotonic: rather than smooth diffusion, the economy experiences a temporary ecological collapse driven by search frictions and delayed skill adaptation, followed by selective recovery. Survival depends on asymmetric skill reconfiguration, whereby humans retreat from technical execution toward semantic creativity. Finally, we show that the welfare impact of AI adoption is highly sensitive to pollution intensity: low congestion yields monotonic welfare gains, whereas high pollution produces an inverted-U relationship in which further AI expansion reduces total welfare. These results imply that laissez-faire adoption can be inefficient and that optimal governance must shift from input regulation toward output-side congestion management.

> Abstract:This paper presents a unified computational framework to examine how generative AI (GenAI) reshapes welfare, inequality, and diversity in content platform economies. By integrating welfare economics with agent-based simulations, we model the co-evolutionary dynamics among AI generators, human creators, and consumers within a two-sided market characterized by multi-dimensional quality heterogeneity. Unlike static models, our framework endogenizes AI learning as a function of human data synthesis and models human adaptation as a strategic reallocation of skills toward creative niches. The results reveal that while GenAI significantly enhances consumer surplus through technical quality gains and price depression, it triggers a skill-biased displacement of human incumbents and intensifies market concentration. Through the evaluation of six governance regimes, we identify a fundamental ``Policy Trilemma'' where platforms must navigate non-trivial trade-offs between allocative efficiency, distributional equity, and ecosystem sustainability. Our findings highlight that algorithmic diversity and pro-creative commission structures function as essential economic mechanisms for sustaining long-tail participation and inclusive social welfare in the generative AI era.

## 🔭 Vision of the Series

Together, these seven papers form a **coherent economic theory of generative AI**—from growth engines and infrastructure design, through market bifurcation and platform governance, down to information pollution and contract reconstruction.

This is not just AI economics.  
It is an attempt to define the **economic logic of the AI era**.





# Generative-AI-Economic-Series
As Generative AI reshapes the world at an exponential pace, we face a stark academic vacuum: traditional economic models struggle to explain a new economic species that boasts zero marginal cost and autonomous creativity. This series brings together seven cutting-edge research papers to fill this void. This is not merely a collection of isolated studies; it is an attempt to reconstruct the edifice of economics for the AI era. We move beyond viewing AI simply as a productivity tool, redefining it instead as a new form of capital and a pervasive ecological environment. By organically connecting these seven works, we establish a theoretical framework that spans macro-dynamics, meso-market structures, and micro-mechanisms, answering three fundamental questions about our future.
