**Reconstructing Economic Growth, Market Structure, and Information Contracts in the Age of Generative AI**

*A unified economic framework for understanding Generative AI as capital, infrastructure, and strategic actor.*

---

As generative AI reshapes the world at an exponential pace, traditional economic theories struggle to explain a new economic species characterized by **near-zero marginal cost** and **autonomous creativity**. This research series brings together **seven tightly connected papers** that collectively aim to rebuild the foundations of economics for the AI era.

Rather than treating AI as a mere productivity tool, this series reconceptualizes it as **a new form of capital** and **a pervasive economic ecosystem**. Spanning **macro-level growth dynamics**, **meso-level market structures**, and **micro-level strategic interactions**, the series addresses three fundamental questions:

- *What is Generative AI in an economic sense?*  
- *How does AI restructure markets, platforms, and labor?*  
- *How can trust, incentives, and contracts survive in an AI-driven information environment?*

## 📚 Part I — The Nature of Intelligence & Macroeconomic Dynamics

**Core Question:**  
*In the presence of AI with near-zero marginal cost, what is the nature of intelligence in economic systems?*

This part establishes the **macroeconomic and conceptual foundation** of the series by redefining AI’s role in production, growth, and infrastructure.

**The Economics of Digital Intelligence Capital: Endogenous Depreciation and the Structural Jevons Paradox**

> **Abstract:**  
> This paper develops a micro-founded economic theory of the AI industry by modeling large language models as a distinct asset class—**Digital Intelligence Capital**—characterized by data–compute complementarities, increasing returns to scale, and relative (rather than absolute) valuation. We show that innovation by one firm endogenously depreciates rivals’ capital (the **Red Queen Effect**), that falling inference prices induce a **structural Jevons paradox** in compute demand, and that data flywheels can destabilize symmetric competition toward **winner-takes-all equilibria**. A calibrated agent-based model confirms these mechanisms and their regulatory implications.

> **Abstract:**  
> This paper conceptualizes large language models as **quasi-public goods** embedded in digital infrastructure. We analyze their non-rivalry, partial excludability, and externalities, comparing open-source and closed-source regimes. The results highlight systematic trade-offs between innovation incentives and access equity, motivating governance mechanisms that treat foundation models as critical infrastructure.

> **Abstract:**  
> We show that Generative AI induces a non-convex supply shock that bifurcates markets into AI-dominant, human, and exit segments, hollowing out the middle of the quality distribution. Dynamic adjustment is non-monotonic, featuring temporary ecological collapse before selective recovery. Welfare gains hinge critically on congestion intensity, motivating output-side governance.

## 🔭 Vision of the Series

Together, these seven papers form a **coherent economic theory of generative AI**—from growth engines and infrastructure design, through market bifurcation and platform governance, down to information pollution and contract reconstruction.  
This is not merely AI economics; it is an attempt to **formalize the economic logic of intelligence itself**.
